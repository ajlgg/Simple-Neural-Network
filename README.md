# Simple-Neural-Network
A lab assignment for CS357 Foundations of Artificial Intelligence, building and training small neural networks from scratch, including linear estimators, MLPs, and a tiny MNIST model.

Creating a Simple Neural Network

assignment goals
The goals of this assignment are:
1. Build intuition for forward pass, loss, gradients, and backpropagation by implementing tiny networks from scratch.
2. Progress from a fullyâ€‘worked linear estimator to partially scaffolded implementations (multilayer, nonlinear, credit score weights, MNIST).
3. Explain each coding step in your own words and validate results with small tests/plots.


STAGE 0 - Setup (Shared Utilities)

STAGE 1 - Linear Function Estimator

STAGE 2 - Linear, Multi-Layer

STAGE 3 - Nonlinear MLP (Implement activations + their grads)

STAGE 4 - Credit Score Feature Weight Estimator

STAGE 5 - MNIST - Tiny Neural Net (Classification)
